# Mac Admin Scripts

This repository houses my collection of Mac Admin scripts for Apple Device Management. 

The scripts are primarily written in **Bash** and **Zsh** and cover a variety of use cases for system administration, configuration, and deployment on macOS.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in this repository typically contains scripts related to a specific tool, workflow, or management task. Please check the README within each directory for specific instructions and dependencies.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided "as is" and should be thoroughly tested in a non-production environment before being deployed to production systems.
